% NB Good idea to put each chapter in a separate file.
% If you put the following in a file called "thesis_introduction.tex"
% then you can include it with the following:

% \input{thesis_introduction}

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

\input{body.tex}


\begin{comment}


This is the introduction to the thesis.\footnote{And this is a footnote.}  The conclusion is in Chapter \ref{chap:conc} on page \pageref{chap:conc}.

\section{About the logo}

Figure \ref{us_figure} shows the logo for the University of Sussex.\footnote{This is a URL: \url{http://www.sussex.ac.uk}} This is consistent with Special Relativity \citep{Einstein1905}. $E=mc^2$.

\begin{figure}

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conc}

I was right all along.

\section{What was I right about?}

I was right about the following things.

\subsection{Previous theories were wrong}

People thought they understood, but they didn't.

\subsection{My new idea is right}

Of course.
